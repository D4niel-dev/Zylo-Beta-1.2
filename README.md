**PLEASE NOTED THAT** this is still a *test* version of Zylo, it'll have some bugs here and there but will be fix
when the full release of the app is out!

```The app use some of libs of Python and Javascript libs for HTML files. Some are pre-installed in the file folder, some aren't like the Python libs so you will need to install them manually by command prompt.```

> **On how to install the Python libs :**
- Download the Official Python app, any version is fine if it's above 3.1x, *older version of Python may break or bug the app*.
- Go into the app folder and click the *This PC > ... > Zylo-Beta-1.x*, type cmd and press *Enter*, this will open the *Command Prompt* linked to the app folder.
- Run *pip install -r requirements.txt*, it may take a few minutes to download all the libs for Python.
- After the libs are installed, you can run the app either by *double clicking the main.py* or *clicking the Zylo.exe (This haven't been implemented yet)*.

**Note :** The app can be run without *Internet* but some features of the app maybe disable because most of them need Wi-Fi to process.
