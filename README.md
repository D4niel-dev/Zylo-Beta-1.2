This is still a test version of Zylo, it'll have some bugs here and there but will be fix
when the full release of the app is out!

This app use some Extensions of VS Code (ONLY) and some other libs of Python,
so if you want to use it then please install all the ilbs and extentions!

On how to install the Live Server of VS Code and libs of Python:
+ Get VS Code install and Python (if you already have them install then skip this)
+ Go Extensions > in the search bar type "Code Runner", "Python", "Live Server"
+ Wait for them to install and reopen VS Code.
+ After they are installed, take the 'requirements.txt' out of the app folder, in VS Code terminal : cd [copy of the path to requirements.txt],
then run the command :  pip install -r requirements.txt (Remember to remove the [] lol or else it won't work)
+ Then wait for the libs to installed and you can run the app by main.py in VS Code!

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS APP RUNS ON A LOCALLY SERVER (same wifi connections) and need Internet to runs all the style.css and Tailwind.css**
