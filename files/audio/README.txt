Place optional audio files here to override synthesized tones:
- send.mp3: play when sending messages
- receive.mp3: play on new incoming message
- ui.mp3: play on general UI interactions (tab switch, clicks)
- bg.mp3: looped background ambience when "Enable Background Music" is enabled

This folder is optional; without these files, synthetic tones are used.
